  ;; We find all the intersections between the 45Â° squares, then we find the spots next to those
  ;; intersections that are outside those two squares, and then we iterate through those spots to
  ;; see which is not within any beacon range square. It works!
  ;; TODO: The *correct* way to calculate intersections is to first take the intersecting edges as
  ;;       lines, convert them into the ax + by + c = 0 format, and then use the Cramer's formula to
  ;;       find the intersection. I took a bit of a shortcut here with the maths. Doing it properly
  ;;       would remove the need of calling INTERSECTIONS twice and the filtering duplicates.
  ;;       The formula is x = (/ (- (* b2 c2) (* b2 c1)) (- (* a1 b2) (* a2 b1))),
  ;;                      y = (/ (- (* c1 a2) (* c2 a1)) (- (* a1 b2) (* a2 b1))).
  ;;       Value a is always 1 or -1, the b is 1, and the c is y0 - ax0.
